CEP engines
Complex Event Processing (CEP) engines are also popular in the IoT world. CEP allows for easy matching of time-series data patterns coming from different sources. CEP suffers from the same modelling issues as trees and other pipeline processing engines. However, it frees developers from dealing with context locking, a common issue in use cases where logic combines inputs from different sources.
