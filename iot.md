	- In early IoT solutions, most IoT devices simply sent telemetry to and received commands from the cloud.
	- Enabling intelligence on IoT edge devices means enabling analytics and insights to happen closer to the source of the data, saving customers money and simplifying their solutions.
	- While the benefits of edge intelligence are immense, the challenge it poses is how to develop, deploy and manage this cloud intelligence for IoT devices in a secure and scalable way.
	- Services:
		- Azure Machine Learning
		- Azure Stream Analytics - serverless scalable complex event processing. The job also specifies a transformation query that defines how to look for data, patterns, or relationships. 
		- Azure Functions
		- Artificial Intelligence, including Cognitive Services
		- Azure IoT Hub communication and device management features
